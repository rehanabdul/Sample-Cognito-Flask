## Running This Example

To run this application, you first need to clone this repo and then enter into this directory:

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Now start the app server:

```
python main.py
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

If you see a home page that prompts you to login, then things are working!  Clicking the **Log in** button will redirect you to the applicaitons custom sign-in page.
